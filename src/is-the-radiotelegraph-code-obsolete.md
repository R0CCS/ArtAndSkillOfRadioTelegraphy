# Устарел ли телеграфный код?

**Outsiders and some of those looking into Amateur Radio often ask this question:
"Isn't the Morse code obsolete? Hasn't modern technology displaced it?"**

Back in 1912 nobody balked at learning the code: it was simple then -- if you didn't know the
code you couldn't even listen and understand, much less communicate, by wireless.

But today it refuses to lie down and die. Why? Not only old timers, but many newcomers have
found that it is a skill worth learning, a pleasure just as any other skill. There is a real sense of
pleasure and achievement in communicating this way. Some find it an excellent means of escape,
a way to forget immediate work-a-day problems and completely absorb one's attention.

There is practical value also. It can get a message though where other methods fail. Operators
have long known that Morse code signals penetrate distance, and go through interference and
static where voice signals can't hack it. This is why low power (QRP) enthusiasts find that it is
far superior to voice. Besides this, the equipment required, both transmitting and receiving, is
much simpler and smaller, uses less power, and in an emergency can often be built up from
simple, available parts.

These factors did not escape the Russian communists. They were also deeply impressed with the
reliability, simplicity and lower cost of equipment for code communication and ease in
maintaining it. (In the same line of thinking, their military radio gear has all been vacuum tube
type to avoid potential damage due to radiation.) Therefore, through the years they have
popularized and promoted learning the Morse code and developing skill in its use. It was
included among their civilian "sports" activities. Contests and prizes were offered to the best and
fastest operators. This would assure them of a pool of skilled, high-speed operators in event of
war. Several years ago a couple of American soldiers who were amateurs were taken captive
from a ship which was too close to North Korean shores. They were surprised to find that very
many civilians in that country readily understood code.

In recent years our own military seem to have awakened to all this, and have re-begun to train
some personnel for Morse code operation. In addition, they have realized that Morse is an
effective means of communicating during periods when the enemy is jamming. There are other
advantages also. It uses the next to narrowest signal bandwidth (PSK31 uses less but requires a
computer) , which for amateur use means more channels are available within a band. It has
much superior signal-to-noise ratio, and in addition, an operator can soon learn to separate
(mentally "filter") signals, which are very close together by differences in pitch, speed and style
of sending.
