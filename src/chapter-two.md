# Глава 2. Principles of Skill Building and Attitudes for Success

Two factors are of primary importance in building a skill efficiently:
1) Right mental attitudes
2) Practice - doing it the right way from the very start.

Neither one alone will maximize success. Here we apply these principles to
learning the code.

We Are Building A Set Of Habits

Skill-building is generating a set of habits. It begins at the highly conscious levels of letter by
letter, number by number, etc. Gradually your skill will build up - sometimes by sudden
breakthroughs. More and more sub-conscious control takes over and there will be less and less
conscious thought about it. As it becomes more and more automatic, your full attention can be
given over to the thought content, the ideas expressed while listening, and when copying, you
may find yourself thinking of something altogether different.

Telegraphy is a skill somewhat like playing golf, a musical instrument, typewriting, etc. It is
learning a set of habits, which can be called into operation whenever desired, and which work
automatically and without conscious effort when we want them. It has an active and a passive
aspect. It is active when we are sending, and passive when receiving. The goal is to become able
to receive and send as easily as the expert does - he is comfortable about it - just as if he were
carrying on a conversation.

Skill is developed by consistent, repetitive practice of materials which become increasingly
familiar (letters, numbers, words, punctuation, etc.). Never practice error! Only correct practice
is beneficial. This builds confidence and proficiency.

Our major focus will be on learning to receive (which is listening with understanding or by
writing it down). Ultimately conscious thinking of the code must be eliminated, and we respond
automatically. Then sending will be easy, too.

Anything 1) that produces tension or 2) requires thinking, interferes both with the learning
process and with using the code.

Relax!

In the process of learning, minimize tensions by having a clear picture of where you are headed -
the goal, what you are going to do and the steps you're going to take to get there. Take little
steps, one at a time - small enough that you know you can do each one. Introduce new material
little by little, in small enough bites that you don't feel overwhelmed - yet not so slowly that it20
becomes boring. Provide enough variety to keep it interesting, and introduce new items as soon
as you are ready.

Take it easy. Especially in the early learning stages keep things at low key, comfortable and free
from strain. Some people learn faster than others, so it is a good idea to avoid all competition
(because it tenses us up) while you are learning the new game of the A B Cs in sound - learn at
your own rate.

Avoid all unnecessary tensions because they tend to distract our attention. That also means we
need to get rid of all kinds of distractions, worries, duties and anything else that makes us feel
concerned, so that we can concentrate on what we are doing. That makes learning easy.
Relaxation and confidence go hand in hand. Each promotes the other. Easy does it. When you
know you are doing the right thing in the right way, this promotes confidence, and that makes
learning easier.

There are many schemes to learn how to relax. They generally begin by learning to pay attention
to specific parts of the body one after another, such as starting with the toes and feet and going
upwards, to legs, abdomen, chest, arms, hands, neck, head, face, eyes, etc. As you concentrate on
each part, first tense it so that you know what tension feels like, and then deliberately release that
tension and recognize what relaxing it feels like. With practice this can be done in a relatively
short time, an almost all at once action. Breathing can also be coordinated so that deep
inhalation, followed by exhaling easily is thought of as producing relaxation. Try it.

Develop A Good Mental Attitude

Anticipate success. "Nothing succeeds like success." In order to succeed you must first believe
that you can do it. Everything possible must be done to guarantee success at every step, and to
prevent any sense of discouragement or failure from developing. Never even suggest that
learning it could be hard. - As for errors, ignore them, except that when they are persistent they
merely point out where more practice is needed. With the right approach and right practice you
can't fail.

Mental attitude is critical: We should approach every aspect of learning with interest, enthusiasm
and a positive "can do" outlook. Anyone who really wants to learn the code can learn it. If you
have the ambition to learn it you have the ability to do it. A feeling of confidence is vital to
achievement, and must be guarded carefully. "If you think you can, you can."

Don't fight negative attitudes, such as anxiety, fear, worry and doubt. But if you do feel any of
them, admit it, and then ignore it and let it die of inattention.

Make learning fun. Enjoy the learning process itself. When I am so eager to learn that I can
hardly wait to get going, how receptive I am and what energy surges up! Watch how youngsters
play and learn as they play. They are good models: they're relaxed and having fun. They don't
pay any attention to mistakes. Imitate them and enjoy learning the code. That makes it even
easier, and more enjoyable.

Stage One - Learning the A-B-C's

Our first impressions are the strongest and most long lasting. So be sure your very first exposure
to the code signals is right - by hearing it. Otherwise, it may raise a roadblock, a "plateau",
somewhere along the path which will require us to go back to line one in order to advance.

* Code is sound - heard with the ears, not read with the eyes.
* Listen from the very beginning only to perfectly sent code until you have mastered it.

To advance rapidly your mind should hear only consistent patterns of sound. This hammers it
into the mind, hearing the same character formed exactly the same way each time. Poor quality
code will tend to confuse the mind, distract your attention, and slow down your rate of learning.

A recent study by Dr. Henry Holcomb of Johns Hopkins University on learning new skills says
that after first learning "how to do it", engage in routine activities of some other kind to allow a
five hour time period in which no other new skill learning is attempted. He claims that
experiments show that it takes about six hours to permanently transfer the new learning from the
front brain to permanent storage in the rear brain. This is something to try and see if it helps
speed up Morse code learning. He also added something we already should know: that it takes
lots of practice to learn rapid, complex, and precise hand motor-skills.

Develop a sustained attention. Attention to the thing in hand is the starting point of all learning.

* identify what needs attention, and
* do that, focusing on it alone, and
* do it early in the practice period when energy levels are highest.

The more interesting the subject is, the easier it will be to concentrate on it. Direct your mind to
go where you want it to go by stimulating your interest.

A stop-start technique will help you gain control of your attention span and lengthen it. It works
this way: When attention lags, don't fight it, but stop all thoughts and clear the mind, then let
your interest and enthusiasm start it up again fresh and naturally. If the distraction is one that you
can identify, clear the mind by either settling it at once, or by setting it aside to handle later.

It is impossible to try NOT to attend to something, such as a distraction. Attention to it will only
make it more distracting.

It has been suggested that the mind resembles a portable built-in computer, but it is far superior.
It can do feats of information processing and recall unequaled by the largest computers. First we
must debug it and get rid of any old bad attitudes about the code and replace them with a positive
"can do" and "enjoy it" outlook. Next, feed it with a "lookup" table of sound-equivalents for the
various characters, and we're in business: an automatic motor-response to the audio signals: we
hear didah and immediately visualize and write "A". Don't put an artificial limit on your speed of
comprehension.

Этап 2 - Практика

Once the fundamentals are well in hand and our speed is increasing, we need to apply pressure in
short bursts in order to advance. At this stage begin with a few minutes of warm-up at a
comfortable speed, and then use familiar materials to try for a burst of speed for a minute or two
at first. Keep it short to minimize the discomfort. Then drop back to a more comfortable speed,
and you will find the mind responding faster.

Avoid practicing when too tired, ill, or all upset and distracted - little or nothing will be gained
and it may even discourage you.

It takes time for associations to develop. Be patient and learn at your own rate. Some days will
be better than others for various reasons. Progress will not be uniform, but that should not bother
you because you know about it beforehand. When you feel good and can enjoy it you will
advance the fastest. On days when you don't feel very good it is best not to push, but rather to
work at a comfortable level which will give you some sense of accomplishment.

As these processes improve, conscious thinking tends to drift away, and we need to keep the
mind focussed on what we are doing in order to advance. But ultimately, conscious thinking
must be completely eliminated and response become automatic (we no longer even think of the
code itself). That's proficiency.

More About Attitudes for Success

Achieving our best performance in any skill, including telegraphy, is a personal matter. We need
to: l) observe how we think and act when doing our best, and then 2) learn to control those
attitudes and actions so that we can use them when we want them.

While each of us behaves as an individual, there are definite principles, which will greatly speed up
our success as we adapt them to ourselves. At first they may seem awkward and unproductive, but
if we stick with them - improvement will begin and grow much more rapidly than without them.
Attitudes are critical, and for best results we need to individualize them, fit them to our very own
needs. We can lay a foundation for positive attitudes if we do the following:

Feel confident, it promotes learning. If you have an opportunity, watch a skilled operator; observe
how calmly and quietly he goes about it. He is in no rush, and is not concerned about missing
anything. He goes about it just as if it were everyday listening and talking. Instead of filling the
mind with problems, worries and concerns occupy the mind with the way things should be done. In
learning, build confidence by taking one firm step at a time, telling yourself, "I can do this".

Build a sense of achievement, that good feeling of doing something well. As a guard against
frustration be sure to provide periodic successes, with simple little rewards for each. Keep a record
of the goals and your progress: as you see your progress it will help build positive attitudes. Give
yourself some little reward after each practice session.

Picturing Success Is Strong Preparation For It

Mentally practice the thoughts, feelings and actions necessary for good performance and you will
greatly speed up achievement - a valuable tool to accelerate learning. How can it be done? In a
general over-all way you may picture yourself quietly and without strain listening to the
incoming signals and easily recognizing them as the printed or spoken letters and words they
represent, and as sending well-formed characters without hurry or strain. Picture yourself doing
it, and doing it well, like an expert. It helps to have a real model in mind. Watch or imagine a
skilled performer (a telegrapher if you can find one) at work. He isn't in any hurry. He isn't
flustered or concerned, he just does it and enjoys it. Repeat and rehearse this picture often in
your mind.

There are at least two ways to use this tool. One is to sit back and relax and deliberately form the
picture. To get started, set up a general over-all picture first. As you continue practicing the
mental picture of how you want to do, add details, making it more and more realistic until you
have a solid lifelike picture in mind. See yourself doing it, how you will do it step by step. The
more vividly you can mentally see, hear, and feel it as you rehearse the picture, the better the
results will be, how doing it right looks, and how it feels. This is not mere wishful thinking, it is
building up a working pattern to become realized in time as you continue actual receiving and
sending practice. This kind of mental picturing can have much the same effect as real practice. It
creates memories, models of the behavior as you want it to be - but it is, of course, no substitute
for real practice –actually doing it.

Another way is now and then to "see" brief "snapshots" of yourself receiving and sending while
you are doing other things (such as driving, walking, working, etc.), not making any particular
effort to fill in details.

You may want to try it right after you have learned the sounds of the first group of letters. Sit
quietly in a chair, close your eyes, relax, and imagine you are hearing each letter sound (just as
you heard it), taking them one at a time, and immediately recognizing it or writing it down with a
pencil. Make the picture as realistic and vivid as you can, even to imagining the "feeling" the
pencil writing on the paper. Feel a sense of satisfaction of doing it right. Three to five minutes
practice this way at any one time is probably enough. You can then repeat this kind of mental
practice with each new group of characters as you learn them, and it will greatly strengthen the
habit you are trying to build.

When you know the whole alphabet and have a clear mental picture of how each character
should sound, you can mentally practice visualizing short printed words and then imagine
"hearing" them spelled out in code. Feel it in your mind as if it were actual - a mental "sending"
practice.

Mental picturing practice may be extended to prepare you to minimize distractions, such as
static, interfering signals, noisy people in the vicinity milling around, being watched closely, etc.
Prepare for these by picturing yourself calmly receiving and sending while extraneous noises -
talking, shouting, crashes - are all around you Think of what a war-front operator would have to24
contend with! It may also be used to help learn to copy on a "mill" (typewriter or keyboard), and
other aspects you may need to meet.

All this is preparatory and supportive of real practice, not a substitute for actual practice by
doing. The goal we seek is for the use of the code to be as natural and easy as talking, reading,
and writing. These mental images take some real effort and practice. Don't expect instant results,
give it time to grow.
