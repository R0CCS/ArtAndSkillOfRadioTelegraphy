Let's Begin With The A-B-C's - Laying the Foundation 

Many good ways have been developed through the years for learning the telegraph code easily and efficiently. Our purpose
here is to present the very best ways to learn it efficiently and to compress the learning time to a
minimum. It is too bad that so many hams have learned poorly and as a result have not been able
to enjoy it, as they should. The trouble often began by imagining that code would be hard to
learn, or by learning it in an inefficient, or round-about way, such as visually, by sight, rather
than by sound or by "sound alikes."

Everything depends on how you set about learning it. It is much more difficult to go back and
unlearn something, which was learned wrong, than it is to learn the right way from the very start.
Trying to learn by oneself without any guidance as to how to do it can make things all the more
difficult later. Most learning trouble is due to one's attitude, the method, or the teacher. One
expert wrote: The most difficult students at Harvard were those who had learned the code by
themselves by practicing alone without guidance.

The Telegraph Code is an Alphabet of Sound. It is learned by hearing it. When we learned to
read our language, it was, or should have begun by first learning to recognize the ABC's by sight.
Telegraphy begins by learning to hear and recognize the ABC's by sound. This difference is
important. Code is learned by hearing it. Recognition of the sound patterns is the name of the
game. For example, when you hear "didah" as "A," without translating, you are thinking in code.
The sound is the letter. There is no reason ever to see the code in written form. So throw away
those code charts-- all of them. Burn them!

Saying the letter immediately, or writing it down immediately, each time the ear hears it is one of
the ways to build the code habit quickly. We need direct association between sound and letter.
Anyone who is stuck on a "plateau" because of having learned it visually or some other
inefficient way will have to learn it all over again by sound. It is unfortunate that some still try to
learn it this way. To teach it this way today is inexcusable.

It is Easier Than You Think. Someone wrote: "Mastering the art of code communication is ten
times easier than learning to talk -- which you did by about the age of two." You aren't learning a
new language, a whole dictionary full of strange words, and sentences where the words are all
scrambled up. You are just learning how to "read" your own language BY EAR instead of by
eye. It's no big job.

Almost anyone who can learn to read can learn the code. There is no such thing as a normal
person who wanted to learn the code and couldn't. "I can't learn the code" nearly always
translates into "I won't commit myself to the time necessary to learn it," or that a person doesn't
really want to, even though he may think he does. Age, whether young or old, and intelligence,
bright or dull, are no barriers. Youngsters of four or five can learn quickly, and oldsters of 90
have succeeded, too. You wouldn't want to admit that a four-year old or a 90-year-old could
outdo you, would you? It doesn't require superior intelligence, just right application.

Most handicaps, such as blindness or even deafness, have not stopped those who want to learn.
Deaf people have been able to learn and receive using their fingers on the driver of a speaker at
30 wpm or on the knob of an electromagnetically driven "key knob" bouncing up and down at
20-wpm. (Even some people with dislexia have been able to learn to a useful extent.) It is easy if
you really want to learn it and then go about learning it in the right way. Any person of
reasonable intelligence can learn the Morse code and become a very good operator, able to copy
it with a pencil at 25-wpm and send it clearly, smoothly and readably.

There is no real justification for the statement that "some people just can't learn the code." (They
don't want to.) It's a matter of motivation, the secret of learning any skill. If you are one of those
who tried in the past and somehow didn't make it, or got stuck at 8 or 10 or 12-wpm, take heart.
Forget what you previously "learned", and start over with the principles set forth here, and you
will succeed.

Some Naturally Learn Faster than Others, just as some people have a knack for learning to play
golf or tennis more quickly than others, so some have a special knack for learning the code. They
catch on more quickly, but most of us take a bit longer. Kids tend to pick out the sound patterns
easily and naturally without straining, so they learn very fast.

MOTIVATION

Nothing beats enthusiasm to learn. Stir it up - eagerness. Couple that with determination, and
failure is impossible. If you want to so badly that you can almost taste it, you can do it. If you are
teaching it, take advantage of any latent fascination with the idea of a special skill, secret code
for communicating: many youngsters have it and maybe some older people, too. One lady who
later became a code teacher said she got started because "the code sounded like fun." One man
found that the very idea of communicating his mind to another by intermittent tones is most
fascinating.

A sense of achievement and the intimacy found in code communication make the effort a lot of
fun. CW is fun if you take the time to learn and to be comfortable with it. Be motivated. Fix it in
your mind that you can do it. Then relax, be willing to learn at your own rate, refusing to
compare yourself with others, and take time to enjoy the learning process. Make it fun. (Trying
too hard or trying to hurry can create a kind of tension, which impedes progress.) Take it easy.
Keep it leisurely. The more you expose yourself to it and the less hard you "try" the better and
faster you'll become good at it. You can't help succeeding. Enthusiasm and determination will
win out.

The sudden beginning of WWII required a lot of operators in a hurry. Many Amateurs
volunteered and served directly as operators or by teaching new recruits. However, the attitude of
some recruits was often indifferent or poor: many of the draftees had no desire to learn it, and
some even disliked the idea of learning it at all. No wonder it took them so long to learn and a
good many failed! -- Telegraphy is a skill whose success depends greatly upon the right attitude.

One schoolteacher demonstrated the code, both sending and receiving. The class got so
fascinated that they managed to learn 14 characters in that one class period. No-code students, no
longer under pressure to certify code ability, who have been given "a taste of the way it used to
be" by listening, have often gotten interested and want to learn at least a few letters to start with.
Quite a few no-code licensees, after having had some fun operating, are looking for more ways
to enjoy ham radio: the Morse code doesn't look so abstract to them as it did before.

Учиться коду Морзе это также просто как учиться читать
Learning the Morse Code Is Similar to Learning To Read

Learning the Morse code is much like to learning to read by eye. Learning to read print has
several stages of skill level.

* First we learned to recognize the individual letters, and could slowly spell and sound out words.
* Next we began to recognize and read many common short words as words, instead of having to spell them all out.
* Before long we learned to recognize short phrases ("of the", etc.) and some of the longer words as whole words.
* Finally an expert reader can read whole clauses, sentences and even a paragraph as a unit of thought, almost at a glance.

This gives us a clue as to how to go about learning and improving Morse code skill. The essence
of code learning, like language learning, is familiarity -- which means overlearning. That is,
learning to the point where it has become automatic, without thinking about what you are doing:
the dits and dahs, or even the words. The highest skill comes when you just seem to be hearing
words and sentences and you are conscious only of the ideas being expressed -- that makes
communicating: a most worthwhile and gratifying goal. But it doesn't mean you have to become
a speed demon.

THE MORSE A-B-C 'S ARE PATTERNS OF SOUND

The Best Beginning is by Listening. Phase One is Learning To Recognize Each Letter And
Number As Soon As We Hear It: the "A-B-C's" of the alphabet of sound. This is the goal of
stage one of code learning- building the foundation. The code must be thought of as sound
patterns.

If you have been having trouble, the moment you begin to think of code solely in terms of sound
patterns, you will have made much progress. A printed letter is a combination of lines, which
form a shape. But children are not taught to recognize the letters of the alphabet by pointing out
the various lines which make it up, they are taught to recognize each letter as a whole, at a
glance. The same principle applies to learning code: each letter and number is a unit of sound, a
unique sound pattern, a rhythm, different from every other letter or number. Each code character
has its own unique sound pattern, just like spoken vowels and consonants do.

Morse code is SOUND PATTERNS, to be heard by the ear. Any method of learning the code
which uses the eyes (such as charts for "memorizing the code", or some other scheme (such as
rhymes or "sound-alikes", etc.) will prove to be a serious handicap to later progress. This is
because it makes us "translate", something we must do consciously. If you have been doing it by
thinking: "dit dah stands for 'A', " you have been thinking in terms of separate "dits" and "dahs".
That makes it hard. So forget that there are such things as "dits" and "dahs" and learn to think in
code sound-patterns. Start training yourself like this: every time the ear hears the sound pattern
"didah" you think "A", and if you are copying, the hand writes "A". With some practice, like a
good operator, you will find that the character just seems to come to mind from nowhere.
Proceed directly from sound pattern to letter, with no intermediate interpretation of any kind. It
may help if you whistle or hum the sound patterns.

DELAYED PERCEPTION and INSTANT RECOGNITION

There is one obvious difference between reading by eye and reading by ear. While a printed
letter is to be instantly recognized at a glance, a code character cannot be recognized until the
whole pattern has been heard -- at the end of the short time it takes to send it. We must "hear it
out".

Two important factors are involved here:

* The characters must be heard at speeds that compel us to hear them as complete patterns,
as wholes, not as strings of "dits" and "dahs" -- Tests have shown that speeds of at least
about 13 wpm are required and that faster speeds are preferable (18 -25)
* The spaces around them must be long enough to make the sound patterns stand out
clearly and distinctly

This is why the so-called Farnsworth method is used: making the spaces between characters
quite wide at first and then gradually reducing them to the standard. Combining these two ways
we soon recognize that, while we know that the sound patterns are formed of "dits" and "dahs",
we never allow ourselves to try to analyze or count them.

We must first consciously listen to each letter until the mind accepts it as a complete letter
without there being any kind of conscious thinking about it involved. We forget the dits and dahs
and just listen to the patterns, the rhythms. So, the ear's "glance" is a little longer than the eye's --
it hears each sound pattern separately because of the wider spaces which separate it from the
preceding and following sound patterns.

These spaces are very important -- they make the sound pattern stand out. That pattern or rhythm
of the letter is to be heard as a whole over a short period of time, and cannot be recognized until
the whole pattern has been heard as a complete pattern. We must "hear it out" before we can
identify it. When we get the sound patterns well fixed in mind it is good to listen to faster and
slower speeds and hear the letters roll out.

Listen Only To the Best Quality of Code

In the early stages it is very important to listen only to the most perfectly formed code you can
find. The ear and mind need to get intimately familiar with the rhythm pattern, consistently
formed. Poorly sent code gives a sloppy, irregular rhythm which tends to confuse the mind and
slow down learning. Don't expect to develop any real speed listening to hash. Listening to poor
sending on the radio has sometimes-discouraged learners because it distracts the mind by
compelling us to think consciously about the details instead of the wholeness. We have to slow
down. Listening to poorly sent code defeats the learning process. (Later, with improved skill, you
will probably be able to understand most of the poorly sent code. But for now avoid it.) This is
also why you should not try to send code yourself until you have a good sense of timing.

Getting Started

There are several ways to introduce the student to the code. One highly effective way to create
the right impressions for the beginner is to dictate a sentence or two, spelling each word out in
ordinary letters at about a 20-wpm rate for him to write down, like this:

Y O U A R E G O I N G T O F I N D I T I S E A S Y T O L E A R N T H E M O R S E
C O D E.

The teacher then assures the students that they will do equally well as they learn the code. "All
we are going to do is to change the names of the letters-- instead of 'Y', that letter is going to
sound 'dahdidahdah'," and so on. Now the student is ready to learn the first few letters by sound.

Another good way, because nearly everybody can quickly recognize the difference between a
few words sent at about 20-wpm, to begin the first session, is word recognition:-- send a simple
word or greeting such as "Hi" and a good-bye, such as "73." Send each one at say 20 wpm half a
dozen times until everyone gets familiar with its sound, then send them randomly and have them
say the words. Then stick in a different word like "the" and see if they protest. Tell them what it
is and send it few more times. This can whet their appetite and show that them that it isn't hard -
those sound patterns really mean something.

For people who are afraid that they can't learn to identify sound patterns, some have suggested
that "V" and "B" be compared by sound initially by sending them alternately.

What Characters Shall We Begin With?

Teachers disagree on this. Some suggest that taking the simplest characters first (such as E I S H
5, and then E T I M, etc.) helps to build up a feeling of confidence. Others point out that this may
lead some students to try to analyze the longer characters, so they recommend beginning with
longer characters (such as (Q 7 Z G, 0 9 8 J P, or the numbers 1 2 3...). This has the advantage of
compelling the student to wait until the whole character is completed before identifying it.

Perhaps a good way would be to start with a couple of short letters first, and then go to the longer
ones and meet both goals. No matter what order is used in teaching, each character must "stand
on its own feet" and not depend on comparing it with some other character in order to learn and
identify it.

The important thing, of course, is to hear the characters at speeds high enough that they are heard
as complete unified patterns, and preferably at first to present in the same lesson characters
which have quite different patterns of sound so that there will be no attempt to compare them.

Methods to Go about Teaching

There are at least two ways to start out: a) listening only at first, and 2) listening and writing it
down. For those who learn by themselves, one experienced old time teacher wrote: "The
beginner should listen to the sounds until he becomes sound conscious. He should not write
anything down for a week or two, but concentrate his efforts on recognizing the sounds. He can
already write, but he cannot write with any degree of ease, if at the same time he is trying to do
something else which he is not familiar with [recognizing code characters].
“As a beginner, he would hear a letter, take a short interval of time to decide what it is; with the
result that when it comes to him, he quickly tries to write it down and misses the next letter. Wait
on learning to write it down until you can recognize the letters as letters, and this confusion will
vanish. Learning to read code is recognizing the sounds immediately, that is, the letters." This is
wise advice if you are studying by yourself.

Probably most teachers prefer the second approach in a class situation. Such might be, for
example, the following (taken from actual teaching procedures):

A. The teacher says: "This is F" and then F is sent. Then he says: "Now here it is again. Write it
down with your pencil each time you hear it." He repeats it several seconds apart quite a few
times before taking up the next letter, which ought to have a quite different rhythm pattern, such
as G, introduced in the same way. Then he sends these letters in random order until the students
get them right about 95% of the time. Next, he introduces a third letter followed by random
letters learned, and so on for a half dozen or so at a session, however many the students can do
without confusion or becoming fatigued or bored. Note: Each one should write or print the way
he usually does.

B. The teacher sends a dit and says: "This is a dit. It is the letter 'E.' Now here it is again: write it
down each time you hear it. Forget that it is a dit -- it is the letter 'E'." Then he simply sends "E"
a number of times as the students almost automatically write it down. Then: "Now we will hear
the letter 'I'. Listen." He sends 'I.' and says "This is a 'I'. Now here it is again. Write it down when
you hear it." And so on through the group for that lesson. After each new letter has been drilled
in, there is random letter practice, using all the letters previously learned. Finally, because even
for the first lesson he has chosen letters that can be used to construct small words, he sends these
words with the instructions: "Now here is a word. Write down the letters just as you did before."
He waits a few moments while the class writes it down and says: "Now then, you have copied
the word . . ." And so on to the end of the first lesson of 30 - 45 minutes. Subsequent lessons
follow this general pattern until the alphabet is completed, etc.

Most sound recordings for self-study introduce each letter something like this: "when you hear
'didah', say "A" to yourself each time you hear it, as soon as you have heard it. Do the same thing
for each new character as it is introduced." Then they begin, for example with the first letter 'F':
sending dididahdit and saying "F", dididahdit "F," and then follow with a long string of "F's"
alone for the student to say "F" after each one, before taking up the next letter.

Whether learning with a teacher or in private study, repetition to the point of familiarity is vital.
A teacher can usually judge quickly from student behavior how many repetitions are needed. For
the self-study student it is probably good to over-do the number of repetitions of each character
before going on, but don't do it thoughtlessly. Some teachers use up to a dozen to two dozen such
repetitions of each new character before going on. Since the whole superstructure of telegraphy
is built on this foundation -- be sure it is solid and secure. Repetition sets in concrete what we
practice. Do it wisely. Repetition with attention builds expert skill, making the connection
between stimulus and response so strong that the response automatically follows the stimulus.

In these early lessons a little game of "odd-ball" may help. It goes like this: the same character is
sent 5 or 6 times in succession, but at one place a different character is sent. The students, who
are just listening, not writing, are to hold up their hand when the "odd-ball" is heard. A few
minutes of this can liven things up and give variety. It can be extended to short words, too.

Learning on a one-to-one basis with a good teacher who can tailor each lesson to the student
makes possible the strongest initial impressions of the sounds and rhythms of the code characters
and to concentrate on any weak areas. The teacher can also safely introduce use of a key earlier
than otherwise. Character "echoing" method to reinforce learning:

1. Teacher says: "Listen as I send the character .. ." He sends it and says its name as he sends it.
"Now listen as I send again and again, and say its name each time as soon as I finish sending it."
2. Next, "Now listen and write the letter down each time as soon as I finish sending it." 
3. Lastly, "Take your key now and send it back to me each time I send it, and say its name as you
send it." It is important that steps 1 and 2 have enough repeats of the letter so that the student has
a clear "feel" for the proper timing when he comes to step.
3. The teacher will insist on accuracy of sending. For those studying alone, there are a number of
good code-learning tapes and courses, as well as computer programs, which have great
flexibility. E.g., a code computer program, which can project the printed character on the screen
an instant after the character is heard, can encourage the student to mentally "see" the letter as
soon as it is heard. See Chapter 18.

If some students think that certain characters sound alike, send them several times alternately so
the real differences stand out. Typically the alphabet and numbers may be covered in a series of
no more than five lessons. Everything possible should be done to make learning interesting and
fun, and to avoid any sense of boredom or needless tension. One teacher says: "I write words on
the board and the students sound them in unison. It is like directing a choir, a fun class, where
everyone feels good about practicing the code."

If one is expecting to do a lot of copying in use, starting out by copying on a typewriter has the
advantage of a better link up between code, brain and typewriter key than between the brain and
a pencil. When this stage of learning has been completed, the foundation -- quick recognition of
every character by its sound pattern -- should have been laid, and a speed of at least about 5 - 6
wpm achieved. All the pieces are now in hand for the students to be able to practice with normal
English words and sentences, ready to build up speed and greater confidence by practice. One
may then begin to reduce the spaces between words, which will speed up the overall rate of
copying.

Every effort should be made to stimulate a sense of success in the student all along the way. This
makes learning so much easier and faster. Let them taste success. Forget errors: praise
achievements. The goal is INSTANT RECOGNITION OF EVERY CHARACTER. That is what
the next stage is to carry us forward to. If there are letters you don't recognize quickly enough
now, go back and practice listening to them until you do. This will save you time later.

Some of the published orders for learning the characters are: 5 0 E T A R - S L U Q J - H O N C
V - I B Y P - W K Z M - D X F G. F G H M J R U - B D K N T V Y - C E I L O S - A P Q X Z
W. E T A I M N - S O D R C U - K P H G W L - Q H F Y - Z V X J. E I S H - T M O - A N W
G - D U V J B - R K L F - P X Z C Y Q. F K B Q T C Z H W X M D Y U P A J O E R S G N L
V I. E T I M S O H - A W U J V F - C G K Q F Z - R Y L B X D N. A E I O U - vowels first,
then some of most frequent consonants, such as T N R S D L H, etc., so that many words can be
practiced from almost the first consonant letters learned.

Note: The teacher should explain at each new step exactly what is to be done and why, so the
student will know what is expected of him. Back in 1895 some psychologists asked expert
telegraphers: "What is the learner's attention mainly directed to as he progresses?" Their answer
was:
1. At first you hustle to get letters,
2. next you look for words,
3. later as a fair operator, you are not held so closely to words, but can take in several words, a
phrase or even a short sentence as a 'mouthful', and
4. Finally as a real expert, you have such automatic perfection that you pay practically no
conscious attention at all to the details of the code, but concentrate on the sense of the
message, or to transcribing (copying) it while our mind thinks about other things.
