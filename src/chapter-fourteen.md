# Глава 14. Слух

Под «Слухом» мы понимаем общую систему слушания и интерпретации, сложную и
гениальная полная система восприятия и интерпретации услышанного:
уши, нервы и разум.

By "ear" we mean our total hearing and interpretive system, an intricate and
ingenious complete system of perception and interpretation of what is heard:
ears, nerves, and mind

Уши сами по себе чувствительны в очень широком диапазоне интенсивностей

The ears themselves are sensitive over a very wide range of intensities, but have their maximum
sensitivity and selectivity at low volume levels. Setting the sound volume level just high enough
to be clearly readable, both protects the hearing and improves performance. The ear responds to
what it hears first.

Тон сигнала

Ухо чувствительно к тону. Некоторые люди могут

The ear is sensitive to pitch. Few people can accurately remember pitch ("absolute pitch"), but
most have no trouble detecting changes and differences in pitch. Not many seem actually to be
"tone deaf." The usual pitch range used for CW is between 500 and 1000 Hz. Some find the best
pitch for copying in interference is about 500 Hz.

Those with serious hearing losses -- who cannot hear certain pitches, or who cannot distinguish
code signals in the usual pitch range because their ears "ring" where the spaces should be -- may
find a lower pitch (e.g. 300 - 400 Hz) helps. Sometimes using a buzzer tone, or adding white
noise to the tone may enable them to hear properly. (Note: Avoid the use of an actual buzzer in
teaching as it has a delay in starting to sound. This distorts the timing.)

The usual narrow bandwidth of tone for CW is uncomfortable to some people and may become
monotonous, uncomfortable or unpleasant. The narrower the pitch range the more frequent the
complaint. They find a more complex tonal pattern far less tiring and even pleasant. However,
when interference is present more complex tones become a hindrance.

Sensitivity to Duration of Sound

In the perception of rhythm the human ear will adapt itself within rather wide limits in the actual
duration of sounds. Our judgment of the duration of a brief sound is poor, perhaps because of a
persistence of sound (like persistence of vision), yet we can judge the relative length of brief
silent intervals rather well. (This is probably why the telegraph sounder has worked so well for
receiving American Morse, where rhythm patterns are complex.) Thus, "If we take care for the
spaces, the 'marks' will take care of themselves." Some students may have difficulty
distinguishing dits from dahs. (The normal ratio is 1:3.) For them it may help to overemphasize
the length of the dahs at first by lengthening them from 3 units to 4. (It is interesting that in
American Morse the dahs tended to become shorter than three units, to contrast with the longer
dahs of L and zero. Again, it may be the nature of the sounder that led to this.)

There are good reasons for believing that we must distinguish between conscious perception of
duration and what the brain actually is capable of perceiving at subconscious levels. Support for106
this belief comes from the experiences of those operators who can receive code signals
accurately at speeds, which far exceed the point where dits and dahs all sound alike. See Chapter
10.

The "Ear" Can Often Make Sense Out Of Poor Sending

The ear is remarkable in being able to make sense out of some pretty badly mangled code, such
as is often heard on the air. It is a forgiving organ: by mental adjustment one can quickly learn to
recognize and read quite poorly timed code-- code whose glaring defects would stand out
prominently if traced out on paper. Within fairly wide limits the actual duration of the sound in a
rhythmic pattern may vary and still be recognized. However, the spacings within and between
characters and words is a highly significant factor.

Some distortions of proportion are less unintelligible than others. Better discrimination exists
when the dits are too fast as compared to the dahs than when the dits and dahs begin to approach
the same length (easily confused). The ear can often read this kind of stuff when "machinery"
fails.

The Trained Ear Can Discriminate Between Signals

The normal ear can learn to separate between signals nearly, but not quite, identical in pitch. For
many people the ear-brain filter can focus on a bandwidth as narrow as 50 - 100 Hz. If one can
focus on a 50 Hz. bandwidth with a receiver having a 3 kHz noise bandwidth, a CW signal
nearly 18 dB below the noise level can be heard. However, a bandwidth of about 500 Hz., rather
than a very narrow one, makes the mechanics of tuning easier and gives freer rein to the ear-brain filter.

It is usually only when the going gets quite rough that we need an extremely narrow receiving
filter -- and then there is the risk of losing the signal entirely if anything shifts just a little. It has
been said that "The amateur ear, trained to dig out signals buried six layers deep in murderous
QRM is the most prized ear in intercept work in all the world."

Headphones Are Superior To A Speaker

Headphones effectively double the power of received signals compared to a loudspeaker. The
muffs on the phones keep out extraneous noises and keep the weak sound energy in. The signal-to-noise 
ratio can be increased by reversing the phasing of the phones: that is, the noise at one
phone is 180 degrees out of phase with the other and the brain tends to cancel the noise. Noise
type ear plugs can also help with phones and/or filters to reduce spurious noises.
