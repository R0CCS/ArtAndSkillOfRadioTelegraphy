Gaining Fluency in Code to a useful 15 wpm Level

By the time you have reached a steady speed of about 15-wpm you will have a useful and
comfortable communicating tool. This will require practice of what you already know, and you
will have to push yourself in little spurts to speeds where you cannot get it all at first to reach this
goal. Such bursts in speed should be no longer than about one minute at a time, and you will be
surprised how effectively this will help raise your receiving speeds.

Instant Recognition

The first secret of increasing your receiving speed is to shorten the time it takes you to recognize
each code character as soon as it has been completely heard. The shorter that time interval is, the
faster you will be able to receive. Aim to make it instantaneous. If You Do Not Instantly
Recognize the Sound of Any Character, You Have Not Really Learned It Yet. (That is the one
character you need to practice on until you know it immediately.) The goal of practice and drill
from here on is to speed up your recognition of characters, and then of words, to the point where
you can both "read" them easily without writing, and copy them down more and more
automatically.

Anticipating

In ordinary listening and reading many of us habitually anticipate what the next word or sentence
is going to be, and we are ready to jump ahead or help out. Most of us can do this without losing
anything that actually comes next: what actually does follow just replaces whatever we
anticipated. By contrast, even at high speeds, the code signals are so slow compared with the
speed we think that for some of us anticipation can create a severe mental block, causing us to
miss out completely what actually comes next. In the very slow speed learning stages this risk is
greatest.

If you become conscious that this habit is interfering with your receiving at any point in learning
or later use, you should take immediate steps to prevent it. This is most important in the early
stages when we are forming code habits. It will require discipline to concentrate on listening
strictly to the incoming signals. (See next section for help in preventing anticipation.) However, if
you are conscious of anticipating but that it is not in any way interfering with actual reception, the
best thing is to forget it and keep concentrating on the incoming signals. In this case, anticipation
will not hurt. (We also tend to evaluate what we are hearing or reading. This is natural and should
not be discouraged if it does not interfere with reception.) A tendency to anticipate does tell us one
good thing: we haven't reached out limit yet and can learn to read code faster if we go at it in the
right way. (See Chapter 11 for further discussion of this.)

What Kind Of Material to Practice

Most of the materials for practice should be in regular English and as INTERESTING as possible.
Have a VARIETY in every practice period so that nothing becomes monotonous. Select the kind36
of material you intend to be working with as you use the code. To prevent anticipating what is
coming next, during the early phase of learning, some practice material in each session should
consist of non-English. Three to five minutes per session is long enough for this, unless you intend
to be working with enciphered messages -- it must not be used to a point where it becomes boring.

International amateur call signs, Q-signals and common abbreviations make good practice,
because they are somewhat "random," but realistic and also useful. "Reverse English" is good
because it keeps normal letter frequencies by sending words and sentences backwards: e.g. "my
antenna is up 50 feet" becomes "ym annetna si pu 05 teef," or "teef 05 pu si annetna ym." - You
can hardly anticipate those "words"! The 100 most common words, listed at the end of this
section, make excellent practice. This not only makes you familiar with them and gives you a
boost in feeling at home with the code, but also it will help you gain further proficiency as you
continue to advance. Work with them alongside other practice materials until you recognize these
words, or most of them, at once as words -- patterns of sound that have meaning in code. Along
with the 100 most common words practice with some of the common phrases, such as "of the" "I
am," etc. See Chapter 22. Once again we must emphasize the importance of REPETITION.

The best way to get these common words impressed as units of sound to the mind is to repeat each
one a number of times before going on to the next one. Use a keyboard or computer to generate a
tape, on which each word is repeated from at least three to five times. Space the words widely
enough apart that you will be able to say the word each time after you have heard it. Then listen to
that tape over and over again, saying each word to yourself as soon as it has been sent. Practice
listening to it until the words come as easily and naturally as if you were sitting, listening and
talking. Make yourself thoroughly familiar with them.

Other Ways:

Several other simple practices can help you gain familiarity and confidence. One of these is to
read road signs and ads you see while driving or riding, whistling them aloud or mentally to
yourself in code. If you have friends also learning, try whistling code back and forth among
yourselves as conversation. There are lots of other possibilities -- find them and make it fun. For
example: The Two-Way Word Game This is a good speed builder, and works this way: the
instructor sends a word and student sounds out the word to himself (see phonics, Chapter 7) as the
letters follow one after the other to build up the word until a space comes to show that the word is
completed.

For example, the instructor sends the word "was". As the student hears W he thinks "w-", then as
he hears A he combines them (WA) to think "way", and finally as he hears S and then silence, he
thinks the word "was". Then the student immediately sends it back to the instructor. The student
writes nothing down. Begin with two-letter words, then four or more letters as the student catches
on and speeds improve. Remember that it is a game. Make it fun. Never again will you try just to
retain the letters in a word; but rather the sounds of those letters, putting the sounds represented by
the letters together as they come in.

How Long And What Kind Of Practice?

Keep practice sessions short and with some RESTING time in between -- doing something else --
such as into ten minute practice periods, followed by a five minute rests. Three or four such37
periods per session are adequate at the early stages. They can be lengthened gradually so long as
fatigue does not set in. Remember that fatigue and boredom tend to defeat rapid advancement.

Teachers are divided as to whether it is better to major on receiving practice without copying or to
major on copying. The best course would seem to be to do some of both. Some teachers insist that
the student not copy for some time after initially learning the characters. They prefer for him just
to listen. The idea is to build up and strengthen sound pattern recognition without the distraction of
writing. (See Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.)

As for sending practice, it is best not begun until the student knows how good code sounds. The
sound patterns need to be firmly enough established in mind that the student can imitate them
without the discouragement of hearing his own poor character formation and bad or irregular
spacing, and also to minimize criticism. It seems best to defer using a key until a receiving speed
of about 10-wpm is reached. At all times aim for beautiful, perfect sending, where the timing and
rhythm produce accurately formed characters and spacings. Aim for it, and don't be satisfied with
anything less. (See Chapter 9.)

One good form of early practice sending is to listen to a character, then send it; hear the next and
then send it, etc. Another helpful way is for the student and teacher to send a short series of words
or sentences simultaneously, aiming to be in unison.

Copying has the advantage of verifying accuracy of recognition and identifying areas needing
improvement. In the early stages the use of random groups is best because it avoids anticipation.
Listening practice, without writing anything down is of great importance and value. To gain skill
this should be done at speeds almost as fast as you can receive by just listening, and with frequent
short burst of listening to still faster sending. This will help the mind get used to more rapid
recognition.

It has been found that it is GROUPING which largely determines how fast one can receive code.
What doesn't "MAKE SENSE" tends to slow us down. At almost any skill level, random
characters will be the slowest, and isolated, unrelated or unfamiliar words come next. The highest
receiving speeds are achieved with connected text, and it tends to be receivable at twice or more
the speed of scrambled letters. (Even nonsense sentences can be received fairly fast because they
have a familiar pattern.) It is the coherence of a grouping that helps speed up its recognition.

There is another factor, which we should be aware of. It is this: when we are practicing by
listening to the radio and must strain to "get" the signals -- because of weak signals, interference,
static or poor sending (trying to figure out a bad combination) or to recall some word previously
sent, this brings the conscious mind into action, to try to reason things out. As the conscious mind
works harder and harder, the receptivity of the unconscious mind tends to cease. This mental
friction interferes with advancement in the earlier stages of gaining speed, and may even bring all
receptivity to a stop. Whenever you must strain to "get" the signals -- because of interference,
static or poor sending -- to try to figure out something being sent, this brings the conscious mind
into action to try to reason things out. As the conscious mind works harder and harder, the
receptivity of the unconscious mind tends to cease. This mental friction may bring all receptivity
to a stop.

FAMILIARITY with what is being sent makes learning easier and faster. Words that are
unfamiliar to the operator are more likely to be read and copied wrong. Progress is about 50%
faster using connected text than words alone. Many more mistakes are made with non-word letter
groups, which are not words than with normal texts.

Getting Stuck

To have a "plateau" means to be stuck at some speed. It may be just a temporary condition, which
is passed over with a little more practice, or it may be something that stubbornly refuses to yield.
Several different factors may cause the stubborn kind of plateau. A plateau is the result of
interpreting the sound as something other than the letter itself. Someone has written that it is the
condition" where the conscious mind is fighting to translate, while the subconscious mind is
quietly trying to get through and tell you it's got perfect copy." A plateau is a battle in the mind,
with the conscious mind trying to translate the dits and dahs and not being able to keep up, while
the subconscious mind is quietly trying to get through and tell you it's got perfect copy.

At speeds of around 7 - 10 or so wpm it usually occurs because one is "translating" the code
characters first into some intermediate form (such as a mental picture) and then translating that
again into the ordinary letters. That is a two-step operation which takes more time than the proper
one-step operation does (e.g. "didah" is "A"). Such a situation is often the result of using one of
the old and obsolete learning methods Again, when the characters are initially sent too slowly the
student tends to count the dits and dahs and analyze them in this way. I have known old time
operators who by long practice routinely counted the components of all the longer characters to
identify them at speeds up to as high as 20 wpm, or faster! That's the way they learned them, but
what a waste of time and effort! Counting and analyzing both tend to keep the conscious,
analytical mind involved where it should not be. This will slow us down and tend to bring on
needless fatigue. One experienced old timer wrote: "Once you start becoming familiar with [code]
sounds as in speech, there are no plateaus."

Fourteen more of them are shorter still: the its to; us am if; as be we an; me at is; it.) Twenty short

Also the 100 words makes good typing practice.

Passing Examinations

Our primary interest here is to help you learn and use Morse code so you can fully enjoy this
beautiful mode of communication. Passing exams is of secondary interest, though necessary to
obtain full licensing so you can enjoy conversing by means of Morse code on the air. Many
students who have started out with the recommended 20 wpm minimum character speeds have
found that they were able to achieve 13-wpm within as little as a week or two of intense guided
practice. It is important to know what to expect in a license examination: the format of an exam,
the types of questions asked, etc., so you can practice them and not be surprised. Such materials
are available for current examinations from the ARRL and other sources. These things will not be
treated here. The only one who fails is the one who does not try again until he succeeds. If this is
your problem, learn where your weaknesses lie and practice to overcome them for the next test.
Many a ham has tried two, three or more times before he passes. Don't give up.
