# Предисловие

The first edition of this book was prepared under a strong time-pressure to collect and preserve
the results of years of reading and research into the best ways to learn the code initially, to gain
skill -- how the experts say they do it -- together with a number of other associated aspects of
interest. The urge was to get the major principles and features organized before they got lost or
buried in my files.

Diskettes of that first edition were shared with a very few people. It was soon replaced by a
revised first edition in which a number of accidental errors were corrected and some
clarifications made in wording. It was also produced under considerable pressure, leaving quite a
number of additional items of general or specific interest lying unincorporated in the files.

Many diskette copies of the second edition were distributed. A thousand diskette copies were
made and distributed free by the Virginia Beach Hamfest and Convention. It was copied and
printed by the FISTS CW Club of North America and by several others, including my friend
James (Jim) Farrior, W4FOK, who has reproduced it in his MILL code learning programs.

This Third Revised Edition fills in selected new items, and adds a new High-Speed Appendix. It
is hoped that this new edition will be welcomed by those who love the subject of telegraphy and
will continue to be helpful to those wishing to learn or perfect this fascinating and worthwhile
skill.

It is my hope that you, as the reader, will find it both interesting and useful. I make no claim that
it is complete, perfect or final, or that it contains everything of possible value or interest. I have
had to leave out some interesting items, especially of history. Perhaps some of these, plus
anything you, as reader, may wish to contribute, could be added in further editions.

**This book may be freely reproduced and published, but only on a no-profit basis
in order to make it as widely available as possible to those who need it...**
