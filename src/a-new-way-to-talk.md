# Глава А
# Новый способ говорить?

Это было в 1925 в восточной Пенсильвании, когда Эд Харт в возрасте 15 лет стал радиолюбителем с 
его первой операторской лицензией и позывным 3NF (в те дни требовалось две лицензии). Его младшему 
брату, который был на 3.5 года моложе, стало любопытно, что это Эд делал и отчего ему так весело? 
Что это за новый язык, который он использует? Джордж сказал:

It was in 1925 in eastern Pennsylvania that Ed Hart at age 15 became a ham with his first
operator’s license and call 3NF (two licenses were required in those days). His 3-1/2 year old
younger brother George got curious. What was this Ed was doing and having so much fun
with? Was it some sort of new language he was using? -- George said:

"Я восхищался моим старшим братом Эдом. Он был моим идеалом. Ему было 15, мне - 11. Я начал изучать
код Морзе подобно ребенку, который учится разговаривать - просто слушая как мой страший брат работает,
узнавая код Морзе "осмосом", распознавая и подражая наиболее часто повторяющимся звукам.

”I admired my big brother Ed. He was my ideal. He was 15 and I was 11. I began to learn the
Morse code like a baby learns to talk – by listening to my big brother operate and I picked up the
‘code’ by ‘osmosis’-- recognizing and imitating the more frequent sounds I heard.

Я понятия не имел о "точках" и "тире", для меня это были просто символы с неким смыслом.

I wasn’t aware of any such thing as “dots” and “dashes”, but only of symbols with meaning.

Я быстро изучил звуки частых CQ, его позывной 3NF и спецсигналов, таких как "AR K", "DE" и "R" 
(всё еще используются сегодня) и "U" (предшествовал префиксам W и K для американских позывных)

I quickly learned the sounds of his frequent CQ’s, his call 3NF and special procedure signals
such as “AR, K”, “DE” and “R” (all still used), and “U” (for US calls to foreigners before the
prefixes W and K were issued), and absorbed other sounds, as sounds with meaning. I just sort
of drifted into it by listening. It was easy for me.

”I didn’t start out with any determination to learn the code, or to get a ticket, or get on the air.
But one day -- it was 14 Sept. 1926 – using my brother’s station, when I was 12, that I made my
first QSO with W9CRJ in Lexington, KY. I was pretty shaky on that first contact and Ed had to
finish it for me.

”When I was 14, I clocked myself at 34-wpm, plain language. I discovered that I had mastered
the Morse code and was able to carry on a conversation just like Ed did.

”So my advice is to acquire proficiency in code, sit and listen, and keep listening and want to
understand it. Anybody who’s learned to talk [and can hear] can learn CW. It’s that easy. Just
live with it and it will come to you. Morse code is just another way of talking.”
[Youngsters and adults will no doubt begin to learn in somewhat different ways.]

Learning conversational CW is more like learning to talk than it is to learning another language.
It is far easier -- you don’t need to learn how to pronounce or hear strange new kinds of sounds,
to learn a new vocabulary or a new grammar. It is just recognizing the simple monotone sounds
and imitating them. Learning it is “all a matter of incentive.”

“In my opinion achieving high-speed CW is a natural progression, if you learn it right in the
beginning and continue to practice it the right ways.” For receiving, George has for many years
been able to read code up to 60-wpm, almost to 70, but now he can only send at about 40, and so
his QSO’s today are rarely over that speed.

Most of us talk so fluently and so easily that we scarcely give a thought to how very different we
are from each and every animal. From birth we are well on our way to learning to express our
needs -- for water, for food, to get rid of some discomfort, and for companionship, to be cared for
and loved. To be part of the family and society around us -- communicating first in body
language and simple cries, and soon in the spoken language of family, friends and neighbors.

Behind “language”, communication is this growing overall sense of our ability to think. Human
thinking is a God-like, God-given activity. At first we tend to think of concrete things: things
seen, felt, tasted, smelled and heard. But soon we begin to have thoughts of things not having
physical existence, things we remember or imagine. We learn to think and express our thoughts
about these “things’ in words, too. And people around the world do this in over six thousand
recognized and different languages and dialects.

Writing and learning to read are other skills, not “natural” or inherent or innate, but by practice
they become almost automatic, as talking is. Learning to write and to read takes conscious effort
on each one’s part, and lots of active practice.

Written records of what was once just spoken have been kept for at least some 6000 to 7000
years. Strings of spoken sounds or syllables (as in Japanese, etc.), and sometimes whole words
(e. g., Chinese) have been given arbitrary, but conventional symbols “characters”). One such set
of symbols has been generally agreed upon within each language group.

Now, what about Morse and other telegraphic codes? Where do they fit in? What are they?
They are more like writing than they are of speaking. They are more like a different alphabet or
set of symbols than like a language itself. The same set of symbols may “write’ in almost any
language.

Many of us today are so literate that we read as easily and readily as we talk. We hardly see the
one as being any different from the other. We can think, and express what we are thinking and
communicate with those around us, by using our native language, or some other.
Let us here in this appendix think about our views and our attitude toward the Morse code in the
above light.

This year, 2001 A. D., the so-called Morse telegraph code reached its 163rd year of age.
Like printing, it can talk in any language. Using simple stop-start, on-off type signals or
motions, we can communicate using touch, sound, light, electricity, radio waves, any medium of
exchange.

It has no dialectical peculiarities, no lisps, no strange or difficult-to-hear or pronounce sounds, or
“speech defects”, nothing to make it hard to understand. Paralyzed persons can use it to “talk”
by blinking the eye or wiggling a finger, even controlled breathing.

More normal people can use it by radio to talk to those on the other side of the world or in space.
With practice and the help of modern sending equipment it can be transmitted and “read” by ear
at speeds almost as fast as ordinary conversation. It may be sent and received automatically at
speeds many times faster, but this is not of interest to us here.

Edward Vail, one of Samuel Morse’s hired and most valuable co-workers, did not realize what a
wonderful communication tool he invented in 1838.

Let’s keep these words in mind: it is a communication tool.

In the early days of telegraphy it was thought of as “writing at a distance”, which is what the
word “telegraphy” means. (See Ch.19.) But very soon the early operators found they could
understand the letters and words from the noises the printing machine made. Then they
discovered they could also just converse together without having to write
anything down. This all occurred within 10 - 15 years of the start of commercial telegraphy.
Talking by Morse code is not something new at all.

How then did we radio amateurs get started thinking of it as something to have to learn to write
down? It is because writing it down exactly as it is heard is the only positive proof that we have
correctly received it. This is called “copying”. And to obtain a government amateur operator’s
license we had to be able to copy it at a specified speed. (This is still true, but at a speed that is
hardly practical -- 5 words per minute.) But do we copy down everything we hear on the
telephone? Even to think of that would seem silly. We understand speech because it is spoken
as strings of sounds one sound shifting. or blending into the next, to form words and sentences.
We learn to understand code the same way, but with a different form of characters, spelled out
as words.

This is something that has to be acquired by practice. In this way it resembles reading, because
we need to know how to spell. This is an added (hopefully small) difficulty for English
speakers Spelling is hardly a problem for speakers of Italian or Spanish, which are spelled
almost exactly as they are pronounced.

These are clues to help us speed up our listening to near talking speeds. Now in the next chapter
let’s see how to go about it.
