Hi Arthur-

Please accept my delay in responding to your request, but have had a
couple of medical emergencies these past weeks.

Bill Pierpont, N0HFF, was my older Brother and he had me designate Dave
Clarke, VE6LX, as the US Library of Congress copyright holder and myself
as the source of granting permission for any use of his book materials.

Bill would have been delighted to learn of the proposed Russian
translation of his excellent book entitled " The Art & Skill of
RadioTelegraphy".

Certainly, you are granted permission to prepare a translation in Russian
and to publish it as long as there is no monetary profit to be realized
from its distribution. It may be also distributed in any form, all or in
part, without pecuniary gain.

Because there have already been several translations and printings
completed, Dave Clarke, VE3LX, has agreed to assemble all of them onto a
single website, so that anyone can download what they need, you are
requested to forward an electronic version to Dave with a copy to me for
files. Please contact Dave to obtain the format he prefers to make it
easy for him to get it onto the website. He would like for you to send it
as rapidly as you proceed by sending each chapter as it is finished. If
after completion. you find some corrections are required, then you can
send a fully edited copy to replace the 'as translated' version.

Thanks for your interest and intentions,

Best of 73
